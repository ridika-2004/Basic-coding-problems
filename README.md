# Basic Coding Problems

Welcome to the **Basic Coding Problems** repository! 

In this repository, you'll find a collection of basic coding problems primarily solved in **C++**, but you'll also find some solutions in **C**, **Java**, and maybe a few others!

### Problems include:
- Fibonacci series calculation
- Implementing in-built libraries
- Classic data structure problems (e.g., Valid Parentheses, Linked Lists, etc.)
- And much more!

### What's New?
I'll be adding PDFs or docs with explanations of solution approaches if necessary, to help you understand the thought process behind solving these problems!

### Happy coding! ðŸš€
