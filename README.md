# Basic-coding-problems

Here I've shared some basic coding problems in mostly c++, some of them in c or java or maybe other, problems like, fibonacchi series calculation, making in-built libraries, popular dsa problems like valid parenthesis etc!!!. I'll be adding a pdf or doc as an explanation of those solution approaches.

Happy coding!!!
